## Requirements

- ZSH
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (command-line fuzzy finder)

## Installation

1. Clone or copy this plugin to your ZSH plugins directory:

   ```bash
   # If you're using this as part of .zsh.d
   # The plugin should be in: ~/.zsh.d/plugins/fzf-action/
   ```

2. Load the plugin in your `.zshrc` or ZSH configuration:

   **Option A: Auto-loading (Recommended)**

   ```zsh
   # Simply source the plugin file - it will auto-load all components
   source ~/.zsh.d/plugins/fzf-action/fzf-action.plugin.zsh
   ```

   **Option B: Manual loading**

   ```zsh
   source ~/.zsh.d/plugins/fzf-action/fzf-action.zsh
   source ~/.zsh.d/plugins/fzf-action/git-branches.zsh
   source ~/.zsh.d/plugins/fzf-action/git-files.zsh
   source ~/.zsh.d/plugins/fzf-action/git-status.zsh
   ```

3. **Add key bindings** (Required):

   These functions are ZLE widgets and can only be used via key bindings. Add the following to your `.zshrc`:

   ```zsh
   bindkey '^g^b' fzf-action-git-branches-all     # All branches (local + remote)
   bindkey '^gb' fzf-action-git-branches          # Local branches only
   bindkey '^gf' fzf-action-git-files             # Git files
   bindkey '^gs' fzf-action-git-status            # Git status (add mode)
   bindkey '^g^s' fzf-action-git-status-edit-mode # Git status (edit mode)
   ```

   You can use any key combination you prefer.

## Configuration

### Clipboard Command

The clipboard copy action uses the `FZF_ACTION_CLIP_COPY_CMD` environment variable. The plugin automatically detects and configures the appropriate clipboard command for your platform:

**Automatic Detection:**

- **macOS**: `pbcopy`
- **Linux**: Automatically detects and uses the first available:
  - `xclip -selection clipboard`
  - `xsel --clipboard --input`
  - `wl-copy` (Wayland)
  - `clip.exe` (WSL)
- **Windows** (Git Bash, MSYS2, Cygwin): `clip.exe`

**Manual Override:**

If you want to use a different command, set the variable in your `.zshrc` before loading the plugin:

```zsh
# Custom clipboard command
export FZF_ACTION_CLIP_COPY_CMD="custom-clipboard-command"
```

**Note**: On Linux, if no clipboard utility is found, you'll need to install one:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install xclip

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install xclip

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S xclip
```

### Editor Configuration

The file edit action uses the `FZF_ACTION_EDITOR` environment variable with the following fallback chain:

1. `FZF_ACTION_EDITOR` - Plugin-specific editor (if set)
2. `EDITOR` - System default editor (if set)
3. `vim` - Final fallback

This allows you to use a different editor for fzf-action without changing your global `EDITOR` setting:

```zsh
# Use a specific editor for fzf-action
export FZF_ACTION_EDITOR="code"

# Or use your default editor
export EDITOR="emacs"
```

## Usage

> **Important**: These are ZLE widgets that integrate with the Zsh Line Editor. They must be invoked via key bindings and cannot be called directly from the command line.

- Local branches are marked with `(local)`
- Remote branches are shown as `<remote>/<branch>` and marked with `(remote)` (only in `fzf-action-git-branches-all`)
  - Example: `origin/main (remote)`, `upstream/develop (remote)`

## Examples

### Quick switch (all branches)

```zsh
# Press Ctrl+g Ctrl+b (or your configured key binding)
# Type to filter: "feat"
# Press ENTER to switch to the branch
```

### Quick switch (local branches only)

```zsh
# Press Ctrl+g b (or your configured key binding)
# Type to filter: "feat"
# Press ENTER to switch to the branch
```

### Select action

```zsh
# Press Ctrl+g Ctrl+b or Ctrl+g b (or your configured key binding)
# Select a branch
# Press TAB
# Choose "diff" from action menu
```

### Git files example

```zsh
# Press Ctrl+g f (or your configured key binding)
# Type to filter: "src/index"
# Press ENTER to edit the file
# or Press TAB and choose "git diff" to see changes
```

### Git status example

```zsh
# Press Ctrl+g s for add mode (or your configured key binding)
# Select a modified file
# Press ENTER to stage it (git add)
# or Press TAB and choose another action

# Or press Ctrl+g Ctrl+s for edit mode

# Press ENTER to edit it
```

### Key binding example

```zsh
# Add to your .zshrc
bindkey '^g^b' fzf-action-git-branches-all     # Ctrl+g Ctrl+b - all branches
bindkey '^gb' fzf-action-git-branches          # Ctrl+g b - local branches only
bindkey '^gf' fzf-action-git-files             # Ctrl+g f - git files

# - Ctrl+g Ctrl+b to open all branches menu
# - Ctrl+g b to open local branches menu
# - Ctrl+g f to open git files menu
# - Ctrl+g s to open git status menu (add mode)
# - Ctrl+g Ctrl+s to open git status menu (edit mode)
```

## Architecture

The plugin consists of these main components:

1. **fzf-action.zsh**: Core framework for creating fzf-based action menus
   - `fzf-action-core()`: Main function that handles the two-stage selection
   - Reusable for creating other menu sources

2. **git-branches.zsh**: Git branch management implementation
   - Candidate generation (local and remote branches)
   - Action handlers for each git operation
   - Branch name parsing and formatting

3. **git-files.zsh**: Git file management implementation
   - Tracked and untracked file listing with status
   - File operation handlers (edit, stage, diff, log, etc.)
   - Color-coded status indicators
   - File path sanitization for safe command execution

4. **git-status.zsh**: Git status file management implementation
   - Show only changed/staged/untracked files from git status
   - Two modes: add-focused and edit-focused workflows
   - Quick staging and editing operations
   - Same color-coded status indicators as git-files

## Extending

You can create your own fzf-action sources by following this pattern:

```zsh
# 1. Generate candidates
function my-source-get-candidates() {
    # Return newline-separated list of items
    echo "item1"
    echo "item2"
}

# 2. Define action functions
function my-source-action1() {
    local selected="$1"
    # Do something with selected item
}

function my-source-action2() {
    local selected="$1"
    # Do something else
}

# 3. Create main function
function my-source-menu() {
    local candidates=$(my-source-get-candidates)

    local -a actions=(
        my-source-action1
        my-source-action2
    )

    local -a action_descriptions=(
        "First action (Default)"
        "Second action"
    )

    fzf-action-core "$candidates" \
        "$(printf "%s\n" "${actions[@]}")" \
        "$(printf "%s\n" "${action_descriptions[@]}")" \
        1  # Default action index
}

# 4. Register as ZLE widget (optional)
zle -N my-source-menu
```
